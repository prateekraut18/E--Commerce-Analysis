## üí° Key Insights & Recommendations

Here are the primary insights derived from the data, along with actionable recommendations to drive business growth.

### 1. Delivery Time Directly Impacts Customer Satisfaction üìâ

* **Observation:** There is a strong negative correlation between delivery time and customer review scores.
    > The average delivery time for a 1-star review is **21 days**, nearly double the **11-day** average for a 5-star review. Worryingly, 1-star reviews are the second most frequent category (11.51%), highlighting a critical service issue.

* **Recommendation:**
    * **Reduce Delivery Times:** Prioritize optimizing the entire logistics and delivery process. Reducing shipping time is the most critical action to improve customer satisfaction.
    * **Investigate Problem Categories:** Analyze product categories with the longest delivery times, such as `fashion_shoes` (16 days), to identify and resolve specific supply chain bottlenecks.

### 2. Very Low Customer Retention Rate üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* **Observation:** The business is successfully acquiring new customers but is failing to retain them.
    > The repeat customer rate is extremely low at just **3.12%**, with 96,096 unique customers accounting for 99,441 orders.

* **Recommendation:**
    * **Implement a Retention Strategy:** Develop programs focused on increasing customer loyalty. This could include post-purchase follow-up emails, a customer loyalty program with points or rewards, and targeted promotions for previous buyers.

### 3. Payment Method Preference is Clear üí≥

* **Observation:** Credit card is the overwhelmingly dominant payment method, particularly for the most satisfied customers.
    > Credit cards were used in **43,797** of the 5-star review orders, significantly more than the next most popular method, Boleto (11,227).

* **Recommendation:**
    * **Optimize the Credit Card Experience:** Ensure the credit card payment process is as seamless, secure, and user-friendly as possible. Consider offering small incentives for credit card payments to capitalize on this preference.

### 4. Weekdays are the Prime Shopping Period üìÖ

* **Observation:** The vast majority of business activity occurs during the work week.
    > **77%** of orders are placed on weekdays (Monday-Friday) compared to just **23%** on weekends.

* **Recommendation:**
    * **Focus Resources on Weekdays:** Concentrate marketing campaigns, ad spend, and customer support availability from Monday to Friday to align with peak customer activity.
    * **Stimulate Weekend Sales:** Experiment with weekend-exclusive flash sales or special promotions to boost weekend purchasing behavior.
